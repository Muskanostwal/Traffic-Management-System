# 🚦 AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System  

An AI-based traffic monitoring system that detects vehicles, measures speed, and counts entries/exits.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project helps reduce **traffic congestion** using **YOLOv8 and OpenCV** for vehicle detection and speed estimation.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Vehicle detection with YOLOv8**  
✅ **Speed measurement system** (±2 km/h accuracy)  
✅ **Entry-exit vehicle counting** for real-time monitoring  
✅ **Dashboard with Matplotlib & Seaborn** for analytics  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv8  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  

## 📥 Installation & Setup
